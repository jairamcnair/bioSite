                <h3 style="font-size:1.1vw;"> Michael Buckwalter is a charismatic, responsible, and disciplined individual. People who don’t know Michael might say he is uncaring about many things, but this couldn’t 
                    be further from the truth. He is assertive, decisive, and determined to be successful. To most, Michael is a student and co-worker, to his loved ones he is a brother 
                    and a friend.

                                there to do the bare minimum and sacrifice their education for fun, but this is not the case. Michael goes above and beyond in his academic career. With a 3.93 overall college GPA, Michael 
                                is the student professors generally recommend to the board heads of scholarships and academically competitive extracurricular activities. His academic merit has earned him a spot on the BASIS 
                                team at Virginia Tech, in which students manage a five million dollar bond portfolio for the Virginia Tech Foundation.

                                usually one of the first team members a leader will ask to do something. Michael has been known to pull the Bullseye one-for-ones, push products to the floor, and jump in anywhere the team
                                needs a hand when he is asked to.
