                <h3> Michael Buckwalter is a charismatic, responsible, and disciplined individual. People who don’t know Michael might say he is uncaring about many things, but this couldn’t 
                    be further from the truth. He is assertive, decisive, and determined to be successful. To most, Michael is a student and co-worker, to his loved ones he is a brother 
                    and a friend.
                </h3>

                        <p id="first" class="article"> Michael attends Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University and is majoring in Accounting and Finance. On the outside, Michael might seem like a typical college student who is just 
                        there to do the bare minimum and sacrifice their education for fun, but this is not the case. Michael goes above and beyond in his academic career. With a 3.93 overall college GPA, Michael 
                        is the student professors generally recommend to the board heads of scholarships and academically competitive extracurricular activities. His academic merit has earned him a spot on the BASIS 
                        team at Virginia Tech, in which students manage a five million dollar bond portfolio for the Virginia Tech Foundation.

                        <p class="article"> Michael is a part-time employee at Target. He is experienced in order fulfillment, checkout advocacy, service advocacy, and grocery. Michael is a responsible employee
                            and he has a great work ethic. He doesn't like to stand around when there are tasks to be done. Michael is active in the workplace and his leaders take recognition of that. Michael is 
                            usually one of the first team members a leader will ask to do something. Michael has been known to pull the Bullseye one-for-ones, push products to the floor, and jump in anywhere the team
                            needs a hand when he is asked to.
