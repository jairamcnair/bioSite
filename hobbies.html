                        <p class="article"> Playing volleyball is Michael's go to activity when the weather is pleasant. Sparse free time typically calls for spontaneous ideas, making this activity 
                            just that. Michael isn’t afraid to hit up the boys after class and ask to play some volleyball.

                    <p class="article"> If and when his friends are too busy to play volleyball, that doesn’t stop Michael from finding something to do. He hates when his free time is wasted doing nothing. If his friends 
                        are caught up in school work, Michael also likes to play some 8 ball at the break zone on campus.

                    <img id="lifting" src="images/lifting.png" />
                    <p class="article"> This hobby of Michael's isn’t dependent on whether he has time or not. Michael always makes time to lift at least 4 times a week; and when he isn’t lifting, he 
                        is eating right. I guess you could say that Michael is dedicated to his overall health, not just making good grades in school.
