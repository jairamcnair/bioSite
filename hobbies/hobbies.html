                <h3 style="font-size:1.1vw;"> As a full time student and part time employee, free time is sparse for Michael; but when he does have some time to spare, Michael enjoys some of the following activities…

                                <td> <p class="article" style="font-size:1.1vw;"> Playing volleyball is Michael's go to activity when the weather is pleasant. Sparse free time typically calls for spontaneous ideas, making this activity 
                                    just that. Michael isn’t afraid to hit up the boys after class and ask to play some volleyball.

                            <td> <p class="article" style="font-size:1.1vw;"> If and when his friends are too busy to play volleyball, that doesn’t stop Michael from finding something to do. He hates when his free time is wasted doing nothing. If his friends 
                                are caught up in school work, Michael also likes to play some 8 ball at the break zone on campus.

                            <td> <p class="article" style="font-size:1.1vw;"> This hobby of Michael's isn’t dependent on whether he has time or not. Michael always makes time to lift at least 4 times a week; and when he isn’t lifting, he 
                                is eating right. I guess you could say that Michael is dedicated to his overall health, not just making good grades in school.
